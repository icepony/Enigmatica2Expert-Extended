**Enigmatica 2: Expert - Extended** is unofficial continuation of [Enigmatica 2: Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica2expert)

The aim of the addon is to make `E2E` even **more interesting** and **challenging**. Balance it out as much as possible, but leave the most interesting stuff untouched.

-----------------

## ![Modlist](https://i.imgur.com/j9H6huL.png)

Here are `+200` up-to-date 1.12.2 mods (about 400 total).  
Despite this, the modpack **only takes 30% longer** to load than the original E2E. And the **FPS** in the game is **even higher**.

10+ additional major mods and +200 tweaking and Quality of Life addons. Some notable of them:

> You can check out your current Java version in F3 menu or on 5th line of file `logs/latest.log`.

[Prism Launcher example](https://i.imgur.com/u1TgH6r.png).

## Recommendations

<img alt="Dark mode screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/208PcOt.png" align=right>

- [**A Dark Mode**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/minecraft-dark-mode-mod-support) - Almost 100% dark mode.

- [**Entity Culling**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-culling)+[**RenderLib**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/renderlib) - increase performance, but can cause crashes on some machines

- [**Dynamic Surroundings**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-surroundings) - better sounds and environmental, but increaing load time and lower FPS a bit

- [**Fluidlogged API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/fluidlogged-api) - adds basic fluidlogging, widely configured for `E2E-E`. Its not included by default since causing slight TPS consumption [[1]](https://github.com/jbredwards/Fluidlogged-API/issues/184)[[2]](https://github.com/jbredwards/Fluidlogged-API/issues/182).

-----------------

## FAQ

- **Where can I download the entire modpack with mods?** <img alt="Prism Launcher E2E-E Window" src="https://i.imgur.com/yghYktN.png" align=right width=200>

  You can't download the modpack in one archive. You can download everything except the mods, which are downloaded with the launcher.

- **Where is the server pack?**

  You can find the server pack on the GitHub release page under the "Assets" tab or on the CurseForge file page under "Additional Files." Note that CurseForge may delay this file for download for approximately five days after release.

- **I launched E2E-E and got a crash with `Exit Code 1`.** <img alt="Prism Launcher E2E-E Window" src="https://i.imgur.com/iiKXQYv.png" align=right width=200>

  Try loading the modpack a second time.

- **I loaded the modpack a second time, and it still crashes with `Exit Code 1`.**

  Try using a non-CurseForge launcher.

- **I chose to download Optifine, but the Java process started, and the window won't appear.**

  It seems like your firewall or proxy settings are not allowing you to download Optifine. Remove the file `config/mod-director/optifine.url.json`.

- **I updated Java, but it still shows me the "Outdated Java" warning.** <img alt="Outdated Java Version message" src="https://i.imgur.com/1hBsDJU.png" align=right width=200>

  The *CurseForge Launcher* and *Mojang Launcher* use their built-in 8-year-old Java. To fix this, explicitly configure the path to your new `javaw.exe` in BOTH launchers, or use another launcher such as [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/).

- **I can't see crash logs.**

  Crash logs are located in the folder `crash-reports/`. If there are no files, check the file `logs/latest.log`. If there is still no information about the crash, enable debug logging and the generation of the file `debug.log` in your launcher.

- **The game crashes on load, and the logs show something about `Unexpected error` and `IllegalStateException: Already building!`**

  In any strange situation, remove `VintageFix` first.

- **What Java arguments should I use?**

  I recommend using *no arguments at all*.

- **I installed the `Essential Mod`, and now I can't load the modpack.**

  Remove the mod [CensoredASM](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lolasm) since those two mods are incompatible.

- **My world has 2 TPS, and it lags extremely hard.**

  This happens when the OTG world rapidly generates new chunks. To fix this, pre-generate your world by pressing the "O" hotkey.

- **I'm getting 2 FPS, and I can't play.**

  Remove the `VintageFix` mod.

- **There are too few hostile mobs at night.**

  This is a known bug, and we are still looking for a solution.

- **I updated the modpack version, and now it's reporting about mod duplicates.** <img alt="Forge Mod Loader mod duplicates screen" src="https://i.imgur.com/Sc18dli.png" align=right width=200>

  The best way to update the modpack is to **create a new instance** and move your world/configs into the new one. You may also want to move the following files:
  - `options.txt` for hotkeys and Minecraft configs.
  - `hei_bookmarks.ini` for item bookmarks.
  - `XaeroWaypoints/` and `XaeroWorldMap/` for map and waypoints.
  - `config/xaero*` for Xaero maps configs.
  - `saves/` folders for worlds.

- **It's still reporting about duplicates.**

  Remove `.jar` files without the `-patched` postfix.

### Considerations Before Updating

Updates can bring exciting new features, but they also carry the risk of instability, such as crashes or loading issues. Despite thorough testing, unexpected problems can arise. If your current version of the modpack is stable and enjoyable, staying with it might be the best choice for uninterrupted gameplay.

## Modpack Developing

This is unofficial addon and not supported by **Enigmatica** dev team.

Some of the changes from the `Extended` version [[1]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1926)[[2]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1773)[[3]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1577) were added to the main modpack as well, so I became a [contributor](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/graphs/contributors).
