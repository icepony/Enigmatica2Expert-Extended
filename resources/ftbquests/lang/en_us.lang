There is a chance that the process will result in failure, though. This will insert the §0rift§r into the jar.

This can be bypassed by using a §7Fission Reactor Conductor§r to connect valid §9Heat Sinks§r.\n\n§23.§r Active §bModerator Blocks§r are those directly adjacent to a §6Fuel Cell§r.\n\n\n§cEach §6Fuel Cell§r§r §cmust have enough heatsinks providing cooling for itself or it will melt down!§r\n\n\nIf building a reactor for power, you'll want to match the heat as closely as possible to prevent loss of Steam.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.moderator_lines.name=Moderator Lines
q.nuclearcraft_overh.moderator_lines.desc=This quest will teach you how to assemble §bModerator Lines§r, reach the §c§cCriticality Factor§r, and how §eHeat§r is caculated.\n\nFirst place a §6Fuel Cell§r, with a line of §bModerators§r (max length of 4) containing a sum §aFlux Factor§r equal to or higher than the §cCriticality Factor§r of your fuel, extending away from it. Then place a second §6Fuel Cell §rat the other end of the §bModerator Line§r. \n\nEach §6Fuel Cell§r will be able to keep the other activated because of the §aFlux Factor§r meeting or exceeding the §cCriticality Factor§r of the fuel in the opposite §6Cell§r.\n\nEach §bModerator Line§r extending off of a §6Fuel Cell§r causes one instance of §eHeat§r. For example, in the above build we have two connections, one coming from each §6Fuel Cell§r, so we have a total of §e300 H/t§r.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.high_pressure_steam.name=High Pressure Steam

q.nuclearcraft_overh.thermonuclear_bomb.name=Thermonuclear Bomb
q.nuclearcraft_overh.thermonuclear_bomb.desc=The §5Thermonuclear Bomb§r has a much greater destructive power than normal nuclear bombs, it is made by following a few steps to transform your normal nuclear bomb into a §5Thermonuclear Bomb§r\n\n§9Step 1:§r Place down any nuclear bomb. Note that the larger the blast radius, the larger the blast radius of the thermonuclear bomb will be.\n\n§9Step 2:§r Place a column of three thermonuclear bomb cores above the nuclear bomb. They must all be vertically aligned, so that the plutonium rods within them connect.\n\n§9Step 3:§r Surround the thermonuclear cores with a "tamper" made of reflective, fissionable, or salting blocks. Reflective blocks are effectively inert and only increase the explosion power by a little bit. Fissionable blocks greatly amplify the explosion. Salting blocks will absorb some of the explosion's energy and convert it into extremely radioactive fallout.\n\n§9Step 4:§r Link the nuclear detonator to the nuclear bomb and detonate it. If the above steps were done correctly, you should have a very large thermonuclear explosion take place.

The sum of the input particle beams' energies must be §6within the energy range§f stated in JEI. If these requirements are met, the collision chamber will start processing the recipe, producing new particles that are output through the four output Beam Ports. \n\nThe output port which a certain particle is output from can be changed by shift + right-clicking the Beam Port with a §8multitool§r - this switches the output slot of the Beam Port with the one clockwise of it (viewed from the top).\n\nThe resulting particle stacks and their properties can be seen in the §2Collision Chamber GUI§r.

However, they can only accept particle inputs with energies below their §6maximum energy§r. This maximum energy is calculated exactly the same way as the Synchrotron's §emaximum energy from Dipole Strength§r as discussed in the quest "Synchrotron Particle Properties".\n\nWhat this means is that the exact same design for a Synchrotron can be used for a Decelerator, as the §6maximum energy§f of the resultant Decelerator will be equal to the §emaximum energy from Dipole Strength§r of the §3Synchrotron§f.\n\n\n§nRedstone Control§r\n\nThe energy of the output particles is given by (15 - §cRedstone Signal Strength§r)/15 * §6Maximum Energy§r. This means that a signal strength of 15 lowers the energy to 0eV, while anything lower lowers the energy to a fraction of the maximum energy. This is useful for §aCollision Chamber recipes§r that require a very small non-zero §6energy§f, like §5anti-triton§f.

There are no other restrictions that apply; your Rocket can be as unrealistic as you want.\n\nTo check if your Rocket is actually capable of reaching space, go on your Rocket Assembling Machine and click Scan. It will both tell you what's missing as well as various stats, as follows:\n§2-§r Thrust: how much thrust the Engines are providing\n§2-§r Weight: how heavy is the Rocket, most blocks have the same weight but blocks with inventories can be heavier\n§2-§r Fuel: how much fuel capacity you have, increased by adding more Tanks; the white line is the amount required to reach orbit, and thus you should always have more than that\n§2-§r Acceleration: how fast will the Rocket accelerate on a planet with as much gravity as the Overworld; white bar in the middle is 0 m/s² so you should always be higher than that\n\nWhen your Rocket is ready, click Build on the Rocket Assembling Machine. You can then right-click to board it or Shift + right-click to open its inventories and check the fuel level.\n\nFinally, insert your Planet Id Chip in the Guidance Computer's inventory, then in the Rocket's inventory click 'Select Dst', select Luna (either on the map or through the Planet List) and click Select.\n\nMake sure you have a full Space Suit (or full armor enchanted with Airtight Seal) filled with Oxygen, then board the Rocket and press Space. You will then arrive on Luna. To go back, select Earth like you selected Luna earlier, board the Rocket and take off again. You don't need as much fuel to take off from Luna.
