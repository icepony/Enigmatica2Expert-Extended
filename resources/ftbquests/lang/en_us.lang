q.nuclearcraft_overh.heat_sink.desc=§9§rThis quest will teach you the intricacies of how to keep §9Heat Sinks§r activated, §7Conductors§r, and about §bActive Moderator Blocks§r.\n\n§9Heat Sinks §rcome in many different varieties, and each one has its own set of rules to be valid. \n\n\nNow the rules required to ensure active §9Heat Sinks. §r\n\n§21.§r They must start connected to a§6 Fuel Cell§r to be considered active. \n\n§22.§r Any §9Heat Sinks§r that are not connected by a face to another §9Heat Sink§r or a §6Fuel Cell§r will not be active. This can be bypassed by using a §7Fission Reactor Conductor§r to connect valid §9Heat Sinks§r.\n\n§23.§r Active §bModerator Blocks§r are those directly adjacent to a §6Fuel Cell§r.\n\n\n§cEach §6Fuel Cell§r§r §cmust have enough heatsinks providing cooling for itself or it will melt down!§r\n\n\nIf building a reactor for power, you'll want to match the heat as closely as possible to prevent loss of Steam.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.moderator_lines.name=Moderator Lines
q.nuclearcraft_overh.moderator_lines.desc=This quest will teach you how to assemble §bModerator Lines§r, reach the §c§cCriticality Factor§r, and how §eHeat§r is caculated.\n\nFirst place a §6Fuel Cell§r, with a line of §bModerators§r (max length of 4) containing a sum §aFlux Factor§r equal to or higher than the §cCriticality Factor§r of your fuel, extending away from it. Then place a second §6Fuel Cell §rat the other end of the §bModerator Line§r. \n\nEach §6Fuel Cell§r will be able to keep the other activated because of the §aFlux Factor§r meeting or exceeding the §cCriticality Factor§r of the fuel in the opposite §6Cell§r.\n\nEach §bModerator Line§r extending off of a §6Fuel Cell§r causes one instance of §eHeat§r. For example, in the above build we have two connections, one coming from each §6Fuel Cell§r, so we have a total of §e300 H/t§r.

q.nuclearcraft_overh.thermonuclear_bomb.name=Thermonuclear Bomb
q.nuclearcraft_overh.thermonuclear_bomb.desc=The §5Thermonuclear Bomb§r has a much greater destructive power than normal nuclear bombs, it is made by following a few steps to transform your normal nuclear bomb into a §5Thermonuclear Bomb§r\n\n§9Step 1:§r Place down any nuclear bomb. Note that the larger the blast radius, the larger the blast radius of the thermonuclear bomb will be.\n\n§9Step 2:§r Place a column of three thermonuclear bomb cores above the nuclear bomb. They must all be vertically aligned, so that the plutonium rods within them connect.\n\n§9Step 3:§r Surround the thermonuclear cores with a "tamper" made of reflective, fissionable, or salting blocks. Reflective blocks are effectively inert and only increase the explosion power by a little bit. Fissionable blocks greatly amplify the explosion. Salting blocks will absorb some of the explosion's energy and convert it into extremely radioactive fallout.\n\n§9Step 4:§r Link the nuclear detonator to the nuclear bomb and detonate it. If the above steps were done correctly, you should have a very large thermonuclear explosion take place.

Thus, the time taken for a recipe to process, in ticks, is given as the amount of particles required for the recipe (e.g 1Mpu) divided by the amount of particles in the particle stack (e.g 10000 pu/t).

q.nuclearcraft_overh.synchrotron_accele.name=Synchrotron Accelerator
q.nuclearcraft_overh.synchrotron_accele.desc=You've probably found out by now that your Linear Accelerator is pretty weak, and has difficulty accelerating particles anywhere above §620MeV§f. Enter: §3Synchrotron Accelerators§f.\n\nThe Synchrotron is a cyclic §3Particle Accelerator§f capable of imparting §4massive§f amounts of energy to particles, up to the GeV or even TeV range!\n\nHowever, §cSynchrotrons are not replacements for Linear Accelerators!§f A Synchrotron§f §ccannot§r have §7Ion Sources§f placed in them, and can only accelerate particles§f with a §6minimum energy§f of §65MeV§f. Thus, you will still need §3LINACs§r to produce and accelerate particles up to 5MeV for use in Synchrotrons.\n\n\n§nConstruction§r\n\nA visualization of a §3Synchrotron§r can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki.§f \n\nCasing Material: §7Accelerator Casing/Glass§r\n\nDimensions:§r A square torus with variable exterior length (min. exterior length: 11 blocks, max: 100 blocks), and tunnels 5 blocks wide, 5 blocks tall, with a continuous ring of §7Accelerator Beam Blocks§r down the center of the tunnels and §eDipole Magnets§r in the corners. Dipole Magnets are discussed in the next quest.\n\nRequired blocks on sides:\n§2-§r §7Synchrotron Controller§r\n§2-§r §72 Accelerator Coolant Vents§r in §aInput§r and §cOutput§r mode\n§2-§r §7Accelerator Energy Port§r\n§2-§r §72 Accelerator Beam Ports§r in §aInput§r and §cOutput§r mode at the same level as the beam ring, connected to the beam ring by a §7Beam Block§r, with a §eDipole Magnet§r at the beam block intersection\n\n§cNote:§r §eDipole Magnets§r can be placed §nanywhere§f in a Synchrotron, §ceven on straight beam lines§r! However, a minimum of 4 Dipole Magnets must be placed in the corners of a Synchrotron.§f \n\nUnlike the LINAC, Synchrotrons§f can have §7more than two Beam Ports§f, but there can only be one input and one output port at any time. Applying a §credstone pulse§f to a beam port will activate it, and its active state (input/output) can be controlled by shift + right-clicking the beam port with the §8Multitool§r.\n\n\n§nRequirements§r\n\nA Synchrotron has the same requirements as the Linear Accelerator§f and any other Accelerator§f, requiring §6power, §9cooling§f and §1active coolant§f. \n\nA §credstone signal§f applied to the §7Synchrotron Accelerator Controller§f will switch it on, with the output particle's energy being §c(redstone strength)§r/15 of the §6maximum particle energy§f.

q.nuclearcraft_overh.neutral_exotic_con.name=Neutral Exotic Containment
q.nuclearcraft_overh.neutral_exotic_con.desc=The §7Neutral Containment Chamber§r creates §6neutrally charged exotic matter§f from one or more particle beams and stores it safely in itself.

If any of the below happen while it contains §6exotic fluid§f:\n\n§2-§r Runs out of power\n§2-§r Temperature rises above the maximum operating temperature\n§2-§r The Chamber is broken\n\nThe Chamber will fail, leading to §4catastrophic§f results!\n\n\n§nRecipes§r\n\nIn order to create §6exotic matter§f, the required particle beams as stated in §2JEI§f must have an §6energy§f of §60eV§f (with the exception of §5glueballs§f, which can have any energy) and sufficient §bfocus§f for the recipe. If the particle beams required meet the criteria, exotic matter is created. \n\nThe number of ticks it takes to create 1mb of exotic matter is the amount of particles required for the recipe, divided by the amount of particles in the particle stack. If there are two beams, the time taken will be the larger of the two beams.\n\nTo fill a cell with exotic matter, simply pipe an §eempty cell§f into the chamber via the controller or a §7Containment Item Port§f, and the chamber will automatically fill the cell with the exotic matter it is currently holding.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.gluon_gun.desc=Contrary to the title of this quest, the §eGluon Gun§r is not actually a weapon! This handheld cannon is an extremely powerful §cmining tool§r, capable of digging massive tunnels in seconds. Of course, this comes at a cost: it runs off of §5Glueballs§r! Don't let the ordinary name fool you; you will need §7numerous particle collision steps§r in order to make this type of matter.\n\n§cGlueballs require the second highest collision energy in the mod; you will need to accelerate protons and antiprotons to 100GeV to make glueballs. Good luck.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.beam_diverter.name=Beam Diverter
q.nuclearcraft_overh.beam_diverter.desc=The §3Beam Diverter§f allows you to turn beams 90 degrees in any direction, even vertically!

However, they do not require §9coolers§f.\n\nTo activate the Beam Diverter, simply give the Beam Diverter Controller a §credstone signal§f.\n\nBeam Diverters can only bend particle beams with energies below their §6maximum energy§.§r. This is dependent on the electromagnet used in the Dipole Magnet, with stronger electromagnets capable of bending higher-energy beams. \n\n\n§nOutput Particle Properties§r§r\n\nParticle beams lose §6energy§f and §bfocus §fwhen bent in the Beam Diverter, with the energy loss increasing as the particle beam's §6initial energy§f increases. Both the maximum energy and energy loss can be seen in the §2Beam Diverter GUI§r, while the §bfocus loss§r is calculated as per normal. \n\nMore details on the maximum energy and energy loss calculations can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki§f.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.collision_chamber.name=Collision Chamber
q.nuclearcraft_overh.collision_chamber.desc=The §aCollision Chamber§r allows you to take two particle beams and §csmash them together§r!

The sum of the input particle beams' energies must be §6within the energy range§f stated in JEI. If these requirements are met, the collision chamber will start processing the recipe, producing new particles that are output through the four output Beam Ports. \n\nThe output port which a certain particle is output from can be changed by shift + right-clicking the Beam Port with a §8multitool§r - this switches the output slot of the Beam Port with the one clockwise of it (viewed from the top).\n\nThe resulting particle stacks and their properties can be seen in the §2Collision Chamber GUI§r. More details on how the resulting particle stack properties are calculated can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki.§f\n\n\n§nDetectors§r\n\nMuch like other Particle Chambers, Collision Chambers can also have §edetectors§r placed in them, increasing their efficiency. A higher efficiency §6increases§r the amount of particles in the output particle stacks, although the amount may never be higher than that stated in §2JEI§f. \n\nDetectors are primarily useful for Collision Chamber recipes with §cvery low cross-sections§r, especially the §6high-energy§f collisions. More details on the amount calculation for output particle stacks and efficiency can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki§f.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.decelerator.name=Decelerator
q.nuclearcraft_overh.decelerator.desc=§3Decelerators§f lower the energy of particles that go in them to a minimum of §60eV§r.

When a Decelerator is switched on, the resulting particle's properties can be seen in the §2Accelerator GUI§r.\n\n\n§nOutput Particle Properties§r\n\nThe §bfocus§f gained or lost by a particle traveling through a Decelerator is calculated in exactly the same way as any other Accelerator.\n\nDecelerators §9lower§r the energy of particle inputs to a minimum of 0eV. However, they can only accept particle inputs with energies below their §6maximum energy§r. This maximum energy is calculated exactly the same way as the Synchrotron's §emaximum energy from Dipole Strength§r as discussed in the quest "Synchrotron Particle Properties".\n\nWhat this means is that the exact same design for a Synchrotron can be used for a Decelerator, as the §6maximum energy§f of the resultant Decelerator will be equal to the §emaximum energy from Dipole Strength§r of the §3Synchrotron§f.\n\n\n§nRedstone Control§r\n\nThe energy of the output particles is given by (15 - §cRedstone Signal Strength§r)/15 * §6Maximum Energy§r. This means that a signal strength of 15 lowers the energy to 0eV, while anything lower lowers the energy to a fraction of the maximum energy. This is useful for §aCollision Chamber recipes§r that require a very small non-zero §6energy§f, like §5anti-triton§f.
